## `interactive_dashboard_lab.pdf`

This PDF is the original lab/specification describing the required interactive dashboard behavior
(dropdown, slider, pie chart, scatter chart). It is kept here as a **reference spec** so reviewers
can trace the Dash implementation back to its requirements.

If you prefer a leaner repo, you may delete the PDF — the code will still run — but you'll lose
the design context.
